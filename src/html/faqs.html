                <h2>What is an off-grid solar installation?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>An off-grid solar installation is a self-contained solar power system that is not connected to the
                    electrical
                    grid. It typically includes solar panels, batteries for energy storage, and an inverter to convert
                    DC
                    power
                    to AC power for use in your home or facility.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h2>How does an off-grid solar system work?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Off-grid solar systems generate electricity from solar panels during the day. Excess energy is stored
                    in batteries for use at night or during cloudy days. An inverter converts DC power from the panels
                    and batteries into AC power for your appliances.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes, off-grid solar systems can power air conditioning and heating, but system size and battery
                    capacity should be sufficient for the load.</p>
